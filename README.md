Microphone Passthrough
======================

Microphone passthrough is a quick program I wrote for a friend because apparently Windows Vista doesn't let you "listen to this device" with microphones.

It never really ended up working well enough to be useful. But maybe it will find new life as a start point for somebody else.

More than happy to accept pull requests to fix it. Also happy to use this project to direct people to any free tool that already does this job.
